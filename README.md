## 1. [Building Simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model](https://github.com/Ravjot03/MNIST-Classification-ANN)
In this jupyter notebook, I walk through the process of building a simple artificial neural network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## 2. [Building Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Next-Word-Prediction-using-RNN)
In this jupyter notebook, I have build a Next Word Prediction Model using RNN's.
