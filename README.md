## Contents :

## 1. [Simple Neural Network Models using TensorFlow and PyTorch](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Neural-Network-Model-using-TensorFlow-PyTorch)
In this project, I built and compared neural network architectures using two popular deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow and PyTorch. The goal was to analyze the effect of different configurations (number of neurons and hidden layers) on model performance.

## 2. [Building Simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model](https://github.com/Ravjot03/MNIST-Classification-ANN)
In this jupyter notebook, I walk through the process of building a simple artificial neural network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.


## 3. [Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN's) Model](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Image-Classification-using-CNN)
This project shows comparison between Artificial Neural Networks (ANN's) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) on the popular CIFAR-10 Image Classification dataset.

## 4. [Building Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Next-Word-Prediction-using-RNN)
In this jupyter notebook, I have build a Next Word Prediction Model using RNN's.

## 5. [Vehicle Detection using Faster R-CNN](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Transfer-Learning-and-Bounding-Boxes)
